React- 
react fiber architecture , before react uses the virtual dom but now it uses react fibre

react fibre is an algorithm to update the virtual dom

Reconciliation - the algorith react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts to be changed.Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is populary known as virtual dom


diffing of list is performed using keys . keys should be stable,predictable,and unique







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
instead of <a> tag Link tag is used in react which is present in react-router-dom because a tag refresh the page 
<Link to = ""> 
<NavLink> - navlink provide callback function and provide a variable "isacvtive" so that when it is active you can change its css accordingly
